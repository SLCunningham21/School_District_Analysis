# School_District_Analysis


   * # Pandas & Jupyter Notebook 

## Overview of the school district analysis:
* The objective of this project was to help Maria and her supervisor prove that academic dishonesty had taken place within the 9th grade math and reading scores of Thomas High School.

### Purpose

* The purpose of this project was to be able to analyze the impact of academic dishonesty of test scores fo 9th grade math and reading scores altered the overall analysis of testing scores for Thomas High School.
* This project can be applied to a real life scenario to visualize when academic dishonesty or alternations have been made to standardized testing and what the implications and impact of said alternations might be on school funding. 
## Results and Analysis:
  ### Analysis of Outcomes:
* As evident from the percentages data frame and presented graphs, the overall standing of Thomas High School was positively affected by the alterations to the reading & math scores. The implications of this is that Thomas High School could potentionally receive more funding in the future due to the academic dishonesty positively affecting it's academic ranking amongst competing school districts.

### Seven school district metrics:

*How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
*Math and reading scores by grade
Math and Reading Scores from Thomas High School 9th Grade set to "Nan"
Math and Reading Scores from Thomas High School 9th Grade means all of them failed (for analysis).
Via analysis tools, it was shown that only  minimal quantity was asignificantly affected.
Student count() Before THS Cleanup was: 1635
Student count() After THS Cleanup was: 1174

*Scores by school spending
Math and Reading Scores from Thomas High School 9th Grade set to "nan" and equivalent to 0.
Math and Reading Scores from Thomas High School 9th Grade means all of them failed (for analysis).
Via analysis tools, it was shown that only  minimal quantity was asignificantly affected.
Thomas HS is in the spending allotment was "$630-644"
Student count() Before THS Cleanup was: 1635
Student count() After THS Cleanup was: 1174

*Scores by school size
Removing Students from Thomas High School 9th Grade reduces the "% Passing Math", "% Passing Reading" and "% Overall Passing" scores for spending bucket "$630-644"
Thomas High School is allocated on Spending Bin "$630-644"
